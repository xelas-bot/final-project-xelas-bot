This project is a spinoff of the popular mobile game ["Head Soccer."](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/head-soccer/id487119327)
Essentially, you play as a head with a single leg and must get the soccer ball in the opponents goal.

### How to play?
Firstly, copy the assets in the repository to the assets folder on your machine. When you launch the game you will be greeted with a start menu with 2 options. After you choose an option and are in a game, the controls are as follows:

| Key       | Action                                                      |
|---------- |-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `>/d`     | Move to the right                                         |
| `</a`     | Move to the left                                          |
| `^/w`     | Jump                                                      |
| `q/space` | Kick Leg                                                  |
| `backspace`| Reload to main menu                                       |
| `enter`   | reset game                                                |

For two player mode, the second player will use the second set of key functions.
