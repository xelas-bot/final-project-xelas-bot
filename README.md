This project is a spinoff of the popular mobile game ["Head Soccer."](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/head-soccer/id487119327)
Essentially, you play as a head with a single leg and must get the soccer ball in the opponents goal.

### How to play?
Firstly, copy the assets in the repository to the assets folder on your machine. When you launch the game you will be greeted with a start menu with 2 options. After you choose an option and are in a game, the controls are as follows:

* w,a,s,d maps to the second players movement controls
* up,down,left,right maps to the first players movement controls
* q maps to the kick function for player two
* space maps to the kick function for player one
* backspace returns to the main menu
* enter/return restarts the game
