# Final Project Proposal


## What is my project?
> My project will be utilizing Cinder to create a port of the game "head soccer." Head Soccer is a game that is played between a person and a computer and the goal of the game is > to hit a soccer ball into the opponents goal. The game the port is based off of is located [here.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dnddream.headsoccer.android&hl=en_US&gl=US)


## What background knowledge do I have on this project and why do I want to pursure it?
> I am starting this project with essentially zero background knowledge on game development in C++ and in general. In fact, this is the primary reason I wish to pursue this kind  > of project and moreso because the game I am porting is one of my childhood favorites. I also want to learn more about development physics engines and this project will include a > very simply physics engine to simulate a flying soccer ball.


## Rough Timeline?
> By week one I plan to have all the physics set up for collisions with the "head" (the player) and other such objects in the playing field. By week two I plan to have the UI set > up and an AI for the computer player. By week three I plan to be in the final testing and debugging stage of the project. This will include improving the UI, AI based on other
> people's feedback and add additional game mechanics if neccesary.


## Additional Goals
> Given extra time on this project I would implement the additional features in the original game like "super moves" and perhaps adding an option for local two player. Another    > feature I would like to add is an online gameplay feature with hosting on my own personal server.
